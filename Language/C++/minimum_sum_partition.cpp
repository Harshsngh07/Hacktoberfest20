//DESCRIPTION: Given a set of integers, the task is to divide it into two sets S1 and S2 such that the absolute difference between their sums is minimum.
//If there is a set S with n elements, then if we assume Subset1 has m elements, Subset2 must have n-m elements and the value of abs(sum(Subset1) â€“ sum(Subset2)) should be minimum.
//Eg:
//Input:  arr[] = {1, 6, 11, 5} 
//Output: 1
//Explanation:
//Subset1 = {1, 5, 6}, sum of Subset1 = 12 
//Subset2 = {11}, sum of Subset2 = 11  
//(Problem Statement taken from geeksforgeeks)
//EXPLAINATION:
//It is a variation of subset sum problem
//We just have to built a mathematical concept i.e:
//This problem aims at minimizing (S1-S2)
//And, S1 is none other than arr[sum]-S2
//So, the above expression reduces to (arr[sum]-2*S2)
//Now, arr[sum] is constant, so we have to just maximize the value of S2
//so that we subtract maximum from arr[sum] and minimize th whole expression
//But, S2 should be less than arr[sum]/2 to prevent the negative value, we suppose S2<S1
//If S2 is equal to arr[sum]/2, it will give 0 and increasing the value will
//further deviate from the result i.e. the value of expression increases from 0,1,2 ..& so on.
//We just push every element of last row of our t matrix in a vector vec & then find most suited value of S2
